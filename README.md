# -einsightdata-blog
Blog for einsightdata
A blog developed by me for ensightdata.</br>
It is possible to add/edit/delete news.</br>
To create a web server, I used django framework. During development, I used the [wagtail](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail) platform to create a blog.</br>
My main task was to create the back-end side of the site, as well as to finalize the front-end part</br>
There is also a mobile adaptation
